not being taken into account:
- shape of buildings
- shape of terrain
- wind
- other pollutants: building heating, factory chimneys
- some traffic could be generated by electric cars
- traffic flow doesn't really represent how many cars went through
- air pollution is probably something like accumulating buffer where traffic and other pollutants add to it and wind, gravity subtract from it
